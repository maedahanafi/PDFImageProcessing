Dear Journal,

I have to decide between UM and Poly. Juan tells me that I have to get my intentions straight. And he is right. 
Once that i have that intention everything I will do after wards will reflect it. For example think about
what would happen in the PhD for instance when the professor's project becomes a startup. Waht will your choice be?
If your intention was to learn, your actions will reflect that when in comes to such situations.

Also Maeda you dont lose anything. I have won because I have a CHOICE. I am supposed to find ou which one is the most l
likely one. And in the end it doesnt matter

If i go to NYU I was urged to also take other classes 

Harshini be filming me doe.
